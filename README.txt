Enable H2 Console
We will use H2 as the database.

H2 provides a web interface called H2 Console to see the data. Letâ€™s enable h2 console in the application.properties.

/src/main/resources/application.properties

# Enabling H2 Console
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
When you reload the application, you can launch up H2 Console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console.

Tip - Make sure that you use jdbc:h2:mem:testdb as JDBC URL.
